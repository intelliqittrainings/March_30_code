Working on Docker images
==========================
1 To download an image
  docker pull image_name

2 To upload an image into a registry
  docker push image_name

3 To see the list of docker images on our docker host
  docker images (or) docker image ls

4 To delete a docker image
  docker rmi image_name

5 To search for a docker image
  docker search image_name

6 To save an image
  docker image save image_name
  This will save an image as a tar file

7 To create an image from a tarfile
  docker load tarfile_name

8 To create a docker image from a customised container
  docker commit container_name/container_id image_name

9 To create a docker image from a dockerfile
  docker build -t image_name .

10 To get detailed info about a docker image
   docker image inspect image_name/image_id

11 To delete all the docker image
   docker image prune

==================================================================
Working on docker containers
-------------------------------
12 To see the list of running containers
   docker container ls

13 To see the list of all containers (running and stopped)
   docker ps -a

14 To start a docker container
   docker start container_name/container_id

15 To stop a running container
   docker stop container_name/container_id

16 To delete a stopped container
   docker rm container_name/container_id

17 To delete a running container
   docker rm -f container_name/container_id

18 To restart a container
   docker restart container_name/container_id
   To restart after 10 seconds
   docker restart -t 10 container_name/container_id

19 To stop all running containers
   docker stop $(docker ps -aq)

20 To delete all stopped containers
   docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

21 To delete all containers (running and stopped)
   docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

22 To see the logs generated by a container
   docker logs container_name/container_id

23 To get detailed info about a container
   docker inspect container_name/container_id

24 To see the ports used by a container
   docker port container_name/container_id

25 To create a container
   docker run image_name
   Run command options
   -----------------------
   --name :  Used to assign a name to a container
   -d:    Used to run a container in detached mode(as a background process)
   -it:  Used to open interactive terminal in a container
   -e: Used to pass environment variables to a container
   --link:  Used for creating a link between multiple containers
   -v: Used to attach an external directory or device as a volume
   --volume-from: USed for sharing volumes between multiple containers
   --network:  Used for running a container on a specific network
   -rm: Used for deleting a container on exit
   -p:  Used for port mapping it will link the container port(internal port)
        with the host port(external port)
        Eg: -p 8080:80  Here 8080 is the host port and 80 is container port
   -P: Used for automatic port mapping,ie the container port will be linked        with a port on host and this host port will be greater than 30000
   -c: Used to specify the maximum count of cps's that can be used by a        container
   -m : Used to specify the upper limit of memory that a container can use

26 To run any command or process in a container from outside the container
   docker exec -it container_name/container_id command
   Eg: To start the bash shell 
   docker exec -it container_name/container_id bash

27 To come out of a container without exit
   ctrl+p,ctrl+q

28 To go back into the container that we came out without exit
   docker attach container_name/container_id

================================================================
Working on docker networks
------------------------------
29 To see the list of docker networks
   docker network ls

30 To create a new network
   docker network create --driver network_type  network_name

31 To get detailed info about a network
   docker network inspect network_name/network_id

32 To delete a network
   docker network rm network_name/network_id

33 To attach a running container to a network
   docker network connect network_name/network_id
                                 container_name/container_id

34 To dittach a running container from a network
   docker network disconnect network_name/network_id
                                 container_name/container_id
================================================================
Working on docker volumes
-----------------------------
35 To see the list of docker volumes
   docker volume ls

36 To create a new docker volume
