Version Controlling
========================
This is the process of mainting multiple versions of the code.
All the team memmbers upload their code into the version 
controlling system.The VCS accepts the code uploads from multiple
team members and creats one integrated project.Next time when the 
team members download the code from the VCS they will be able to
access the code created by the entire team.

VCS's also preserve older and latest versions of the code
so that the team members can toggle between any version based
on requirement

VCS's track who is making what kind of changes and at what time
these changes are done

VCS's are of 2 types
1 Centralised Version Controlling
2 Distributed Version Controlling

Centralised Version Controlling
=====================================
Here we have a remote server where version contrlling happens,all the
team members simply checkin their code into the remote server.

Distributed Version Controlling
====================================
Here we have a Local Repository installed on individual team memebers
machines where version controlling happens at the level of individual
team member.From here the code can be uploaded into a remote server
wehere version controlling  happens at the level of the entire team.
